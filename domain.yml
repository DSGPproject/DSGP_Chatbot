This disease is characterized by the appearance of small, circular to irregularly shaped spots on the leaves, which may start as yellow or brown lesions and develop red or purple margins as they mature. The fungi responsible for Red Leaf Spot thrive in warm and humid conditions, making tea plantations in such climates particularly susceptible to this disease. Red Leaf Spot can spread rapidly under favorable environmental conditions, leading to widespread damage to tea leaves if left unchecked."
